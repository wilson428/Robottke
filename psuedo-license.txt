Thank you for contributing to the Robottke project! I indend to eventually make this an open source project, both for practical reasons and to be a good citizen. Because this was developed while I was on the clock at Slate, I don't yet feel comfortable open-sourcing it. (By the same token, I can't choose to contribute make my articles to Creative Commons--Slate shares the copyright.
So for the moment, I'm calling this "ajar source." All of you who have been so kind as to contribute to this project are of course welcome to use the combined code for your own purposes. I will also generously credit anyone who wishes to be credited on Slate as we improve Robottke. I'm happy to invite anyone to the project, but it cannot yet go OS.
Any questions, you can get me at christopher.e.wilson+Robottke@gmail.com or (202) 261-2079
